# AppointMate

### What is it?

AppointMate is an AI powered assistant that helps to schedule appointments with professionals. In the past, you may have had to wait on hold for ages or wait for days to recieve an email response from an office to set up your appointments. However, with AppointMate, those days are gone. Recieve an AI response instantly and sign up for your appointment through a conversation with rigorously trained AI, getting what used to take hours or days done in a sliver of that time.

### How does it work?

Powered by [Teli AI](https://home.teli.ai/), AppointMate uses artificial intelligence to converse with the user and gather information about when the user has availability. With this info, the AI is able to cross-reference it with the schedule of the office and suggest times that work for both parties. Once a time has been decided, AppointMate reserves that time on the office's calendar and both the user and the office are done in a matter of minutes.

### Why was it made?

Throughout our times in college, everyone in the group has had experienced the annoying experience of having to wait ages for a response from an organization or professor when trying to schedule a meeting. The best way to address this was simply making a solution ourselves. We hope that this or something similar becomes more and more common to address the issue of slow responses from offices around the world.
